# Ubuntu Server Administration
## Overview
Ubuntu Server is the primary operating system used throughout this homelab. It provides the foundation for learning Linux administration, enterprise networking, security monitoring, security monitoring, and server management.
This project documents the installation, configuration, and administration of Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS while developing skills commonly used by systems administrators, SOC analysts, and cybersecurity engineers. I have also included the challenges I encountered installing and using this system, the resolutions I came to after troubleshooting, and the lessons I learned from the problems and solutions.

### Technologies
- Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
- OpenSSH
- APT Package Manager
#### Skills Developed
- Linux installation
- Server Administration
- User Management
- Package Management
- SSH Configuration
- File System Navigation
- Basic Security Hardening
- Troubleshooting
##### Enterprise Relevance
Linux servers powers a significant portion of enterprise infrastructure, cloud environments, and cybersecurity platforms. Developing proficiency with Linux administration is essential for security operations, system administration, cloud engineering, and detection engineering roles.
##### Current Status
- Ubuntu Server Installed? COMPLETE
- OpenSSH configured? COMPLETE
- Linux Administration? In Progress
-Linux Fundamentals? In Progress
##### Challenges Encountered
- Problem 1
During the Ubuntu installation, several enterprise deployment options were presented and this was an entirely new system to me as far as using this hands-on. Those options were LVM, disk encryption, Ubuntu Pro, proxy configuration, and OpenSSH. Determining which options were appropriate required me to refer to open source intelligence to understand how each would impact the server. 
- Resolution
I researched each option before continuing and chose to: 
-Enable LVM
-Disable disk encryption
-Skip proxy configuration
-Skip Ubuntu PRO
-Install OpenSSH Server
These selections created a functional enterprise server while allowing me to understand the purpose of each installation option. 
-Lesson Learned
Enterprise Linux installations require planning rather than accepting default settings. Understanding each installation choice helps build a stronger foundation for future server deployments.

- Problem 2
Coming from limited Linux experience, performing all administration through the terminal required learning an entirely new workflow.

-Resolution
I practiced navigating the Linux file system, creating, deleting, and managing files and directories, changing permissions, updating the operating system, and practicing essential Linux commands.

-Lesson Learned
Becoming comfortable with the Linux command line and mastering this will take some time and repeated use and practice. However, this is a must as it seems essential because most enterprise Linux servers are administered remotely without a graphiccal interface.
